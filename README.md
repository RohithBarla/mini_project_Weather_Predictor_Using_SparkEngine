# Weather Predictor Using Spark

## Overview
The **Weather Predictor Application** is a data-driven project that leverages **Apache Spark** to analyze historical weather data and predict future weather conditions. The application processes large-scale weather datasets efficiently and applies machine learning algorithms to make accurate predictions.

## Features
- Ingests and processes large weather datasets using **PySpark**
- Performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Handles missing values and cleans the dataset
- Trains a **Machine Learning model** (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) for weather prediction
- Predicts weather parameters such as **temperature, humidity, and rainfall**
- Provides real-time insights with **Spark Streaming (if applicable)**

## Tech Stack
- **Apache Spark** (PySpark)
- **MLlib** (Sparkâ€™s Machine Learning library)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook / Databricks** (for development)
- **Kafka** (if streaming is involved)

## Dataset
The model is trained on weather datasets that include parameters such as:
- Date & Time
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- Atmospheric Pressure
- Rainfall/Snowfall

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-predictor.git
   cd weather-predictor
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Start the application (Databricks/Spark local):
   ```bash
   spark-submit main.py
   ```

## Usage
- Load the dataset in **CSV/Parquet** format
- Perform **data preprocessing** and feature selection
- Train the model using **Spark MLlib**
- Make predictions on test data
- Evaluate the model's accuracy
- Visualize trends and insights

## Example Code Snippet
```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler

# Initialize Spark Session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("WeatherPredictor").getOrCreate()

# Load dataset
data = spark.read.csv("weather_data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Feature Engineering
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=["temperature", "humidity", "wind_speed"], outputCol="features")
data = assembler.transform(data)

# Train Model
lr = LinearRegression(featuresCol="features", labelCol="rainfall")
model = lr.fit(data)

# Predictions
predictions = model.transform(data)
predictions.show()
```

## Results
- **Accuracy**: XX% (varies based on dataset and model used)
- **Predicted Outputs**: Graphs showing temperature trends, humidity variations, and rainfall probability

## Future Improvements
- Implement **Deep Learning** models (LSTMs) for time series forecasting
- Integrate with **Real-Time APIs** for live predictions
- Deploy as a **Flask/Django Web App**
